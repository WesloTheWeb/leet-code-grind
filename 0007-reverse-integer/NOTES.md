# Findings
- Reversing the number, even if they're negatives.
- also includes negative.
- if there is a 0, do not include it like example 3
​
# Approach
**Naive**
- Iterate the array, turn to string string
- from the end backwards to output.
-  add condition to not include 0 if at the end when reverse for printining output
- convert string to integer
