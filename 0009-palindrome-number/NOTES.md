We need to account for negative numbers
**same number forward and backwards, left to right**
Basis of palindromes....

999,
1001, a palindrome in the 1000s? if not then its based off of 1001
2002,
3003,
9999,
10001
101101  <-- can be as big as this 101,101

clarifying questions:
- can a single number be palindrome?
- account 4 digit numbers
-
I am seeing modulo factor of 11 as each hundreth place is the same of the last digit (i.e **2**0**2** anything that the single digits match the hundreth digit
â€‹
these numbers can be divided by using their a digit of their number, but on appropriate hundreth place
at the 99th place we seem to be adding + 2 and then continuing from there
