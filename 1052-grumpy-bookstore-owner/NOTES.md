​
customers[i] is the number of the customer that enters the store at the start of the ith minute and all those customers leave after the end of that minute.
​
grumpy[i] is 1 if the bookstore owner is grumpy during the ith minute, and is 0 otherwise.
​
When the bookstore owner is grumpy, the customers of that minute are not satisfied, otherwise, they are satisfied.
​
The bookstore owner knows a secret technique to keep themselves not grumpy for minutes consecutive minutes, but can only use it once.
​
Attempt:
We start by initializing variables for the number of satisfied customers, the maximum additional satisfied customers, and the additional satisfied customers that we can get using the secret technique.
​
We then calculate the number of satisfied customers without using the secret technique by iterating through the arrays and adding the number of satisfied customers to the "satisfiedCustomers" variable for every minute when the bookstore owner is not grumpy.
​
Next, we use a sliding window of size "minutes" to calculate the additional number of satisfied customers that we can get by using the secret technique. We start by initializing a variable for the additional satisfied customers to zero. We then iterate through the first "minutes" minutes of the day and add the number of customers to the "additionalSatisfiedCustomers" variable for every minute when the bookstore owner is grumpy.
​
We then iterate through the remaining minutes of the day using a sliding window. For each window, we add the number of customers to the "additionalSatisfiedCustomers" variable for every minute when the bookstore owner is grumpy inside the window and subtract the number of customers for every minute when the bookstore owner was grumpy outside the window. We update the "maxAdditionalSatisfiedCustomers" variable to keep track of the maximum additional satisfied customers that we can get using the secret technique.
​
Finally, we return the sum of the number of satisfied customers without using the secret technique and the maximum additional satisfied customers that we can get using the secret technique.
