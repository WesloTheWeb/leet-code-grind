Step 1.) Understand the Problem
The problem is asking to split a group of n people into two groups of any size, where each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group. The input is an integer n and an array of dislike pairs. We need to determine if it is possible to split the group into two groups without any disliked pairs ending up in the same group.
​
Step 2.) Identify possible solutions
One possible solution is to use graph theory to represent the dislikes between people and then use a graph coloring algorithm to determine if it is possible to split the group into two groups without any disliked pairs ending up in the same group. Another possible solution is to use a depth-first search algorithm to traverse the graph of dislikes and color the nodes as we go along.
​
Step 3.) Choose a Solution
We will choose the graph theory solution because it is a more efficient approach.
​
Step 4.) Build It.
​
Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties of graphs, which are structures that consist of nodes (also called vertices) connected by edges (also called arcs or lines). In computer science, graphs are often used to represent relationships between objects.
​
In this problem, we used graph theory to represent the dislikes between people. We constructed an undirected graph where each person was represented by a node, and each dislike pair was represented by an edge between the two corresponding nodes. Then, we used a graph coloring algorithm to determine if it was possible to split the group into two groups without any disliked pairs ending up in the same group.
​
The graph coloring algorithm works by assigning a color (either 1 or -1) to each node in the graph, such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. We start by assigning color 1 to an arbitrary node and then perform a depth-first search traversal of the graph. For each neighbor of the current node, we assign the opposite color (-1), and if a neighbor already has the same color as the current node, we know that it is not possible to split the group into two groups without any disliked pairs ending up in the same group, so we return false. If we can traverse the entire graph without any conflicts, we return true.
