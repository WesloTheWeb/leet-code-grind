/*
PROBLEM:
- Array of characters
- Each letter represents a task
- Can be done any order
- "n" represents cooldown period between two SAME tasks (same letter) 
must be "n" units of time between the two same tasks. 
- "n" is given. 
Goal: Return the least number of times that the CPU will take to finish all of the given tasks.
 
APPROACH:

*/
var leastInterval = function(tasks, n) {
   // Get all the tasks which are letters of the alphabet from 'A' to 'Z' and add them in an array or a map
let charMap = new Map();

// Keep track of the task with max frequency and its count
// Let's start with the first task as the max occurring for now
let maxOccurringTask = tasks[0];
let maxOccurrences = 0;

// While we add our tasks to our map, we also maintain a running count of max occurrences and the max task
for (let char of tasks) {
    if (charMap.has(char)) {
        charMap.set(char, charMap.get(char) + 1);

        maxOccurrences = charMap.get(char);
        maxOccurringTask = char;
    }
}

// If we have the max occuring task frequency and we subtract it by 1 (because the edges don't need to maintain the n distance) and multiply this value by n, we get the number of spaces we need to fill.
// These spaces could be filled with idle values or other tasks
let idleCount = (maxOccurrences - 1) * n;


// Now iterate through the char map and for each entry subtract the idle count accordingly
charMap.forEach((value, key) => {
    // value here is the count and key is the task
    if (key === maxOccurringTask) {
        return; // return here acts like a continue, meaning do nothing. We do nothing here because max occurring task has already been accounted for. we're only filling in other tasks where idle values are present
    }

    // If another task has the same number of occurrences as the max occurring task, it doesn't take the place of an idle entry. so we only need to subtract 1 less than the number of occurrences it has.. because the last occurrence will not be
    // replaced by an idle entry
    if (value === maxOccurrences) {
        idleCount -= (value - 1);
    } else {
        // for all other tasks, we can just subtract that many idle entries from their counts
        idleCount -= value;
    }
});

// If there are no idle spaces, that means that all tasks are able to be scheduled without the processor being idle. we can just return the tasks length.
if (idleCount <= 0) {
    return tasks.length;

return tasks.length + idleCount
