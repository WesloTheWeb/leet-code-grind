# Findings
- We just want all the subsets of a nums array.
- Includes nothing
- This is a backtracking problem
​
# Approach
Of course! The solution you provided uses a recursive approach to generate all possible subsets of the given array nums. Let's break down the approach:
​
**Base Case:**
If the array nums is empty, the only subset of an empty set is an empty set. Thus, it returns [[]].
Recursive Case:
​
The idea is to split the problem into smaller problems. At each recursive step, you're picking the first element of the nums array (first), and then you're generating subsets for the rest of the elements in the array (remainingElements).
Generating Subsets:
​
For the remainingElements, you recursively call the subsets function. This returns all subsets that don't include the first element (withoutFirstElement).
Then, you generate subsets that include the first element. To do this, you map over the withoutFirstElement array and for each subset, you prepend the first element (withFirstElement).
Combining Results:
​
Once you have the subsets without the first element and the subsets with the first element, you simply concatenate both arrays to get all possible subsets.
Time Complexity:
​
The comment at the end mentions O(2^n) time complexity. This is because, for each element in the array, you are essentially doubling the number of subsets: once for the subsets without the element and once for the subsets with the element. If there are n elements, you can think of this as a binary tree of depth n where each level doubles the number of subsets from the previous level.
