# Findings / Assumptions
- This is a backtracking / all possibility placement of queens decision tres.
- We can exploit this since the board is n x n and we have **n-queens that move horizontally, vertically, pos. diagonal (top right), and neg. diagonal (bottom-left)**.
- With that knowledge we can determine our queen positions.
